# Diamonds Game

Another variation of the game [“Tic Tac Toe”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), but often instead of the classic symbols they write the first letter of their name.

## About the Game

The game begins with everyone delineating one square of the playing field and putting “their” letter there. Then the players take turns placing one line on the field (in any order).

The goal of each player is to place lines so that the opponent cannot “cover” the square with his line. You get whole labyrinths, especially on a large field.

One of the players may make a mistake and not notice that he has “substituted” a square for the other. The one who “closed” the square with his line puts his letter in it - he wins the square. If, after closing one square, it immediately becomes possible to close another one, the same player closes it. He must put his line when he has closed all the “free” squares.

After all the cells are filled, count how many letters there are. The player with the most letters wins.
